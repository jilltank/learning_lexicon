Bootstrap,"a collection of pre-written CSS rules used to create websites faster. provides style components for things like grid layouts, navigation, showcases, etc"
grid,useful way to configure page layouts. bootstraps's grid comes with 12 columns of equal size. html elements are arranged to span any number of columns in order to create custom page layouts
"<div class=""row"">

<div class=""col-md-6"">
<h4> Content 2 </h4>
</div>

</div>","this is the code you use to specify the number of boostrap columns to span. you're looking mostly at the ""col-md-6"" and ""row"". the 6 is the reference to the number of columns to span. The row means that we've created a horizontal group."
"<ul class=""nav nav-tabs"">
<li> <a href=""#"">Home</a></li>
<li class=""active""><a href=""#"">Social</a></li>
<li> <a href=""#"">Promotions</a></li>
<li> <a href=""#"">Updates</a></li>
</ul>","so here we've taken normal li (list items) and turned them into navigation tabs by calling the bootstrap class ""nav nav-tabs"". the class=""active"" means that this will be the curently open tab. "
"<ul class=""nav nav-pills"">
...
</ul>","this is really similar to the nav-tabs except these create pills, with the darkened pillbox being the currently active one."
"<div class=""jumbotron"">
...
</div>",this is a massive bannerlike showcase featuring important content. Bootstrap refers to it as a jumbotron

  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""main.css"" >
</head>","just like with links and CSS stylesheets, you have to tell HTML that you're using bootstrap to style your page. You put it between the font.css and the main.css. Listing it this way tells the browser that the files in your main.css stylesheet are more important than the ones in bootstrap, so that will file it accordingly."
http://getbootstrap.com/css/,website that lists a whole bunch of ways you can use bootstrap to style your website
" <ul class=""pull-left"">","so, for example, you want your navigation bar to have left-justified and/or right-justified items, you find those specific item tags (in this case, the ul tag), and add to the tag class=""pull-left"" or class=""pull-right"". This will justify them to the left or the right, depending on which you call."
"<div class=""container"">

  <div class=""row"">
    <div class=""col-md-4"">
      ...
    </div>

    <div class=""col-md-4"">
      ...
    </div>

    <div class=""col-md-4"">
      ...
    </div>

  </div>
</div>","this is how you use boostrap to move your pages around in a grid style. You tell the page that you want these elements all in one column by calling <div class=""column"">. You tell it to call a row the same way I mentioned above, specifying how many rows you want it to span."
"<div class=""thumbnail"">
<img src=""..."" >
</div>","this is bootstrap's easy way to display grids of images. an image element is wrapped in a class element with the tag ""thumbnail."""
